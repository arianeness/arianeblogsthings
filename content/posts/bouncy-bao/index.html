<p>The COVID lockdown here in Manila has led me to revisit some childhood “dreams” that I thought were too silly or unattainable for me to achieve. One of those dreams was to be a game designer.</p>
<p>So I bought a $11.99 course on udemy.com (Amazing course, BTW. Can’t recommend it enough. Get it <a href="https://www.udemy.com/share/101WjsAkIddllVQXo=/">HERE!</a> ), and I started programming away!</p>
<p>With the combination of my digital drawing skills, good instructors from udemy.com, and Unity, I’m ready to unveil my first ever video game! I had so much fun designing the whole set, creating graphics, and coding on C# while I was working on this project. This whole ordeal has taught me to have a deeper appreciation for game developers who make these games for our entertainment.</p>
<p>Hopefully, I get good enough at this hobby to make meaningful games of my own. But for now, the simple gameplay and message of Bouncy Bao will have to do.</p>
<p>The mechanics of the game are simple:
Break the blocks to help Bouncy Bao transform himself into a new snack. Move the bamboo steamer using your mouse to make Bouncy Bao bounce and break the blocks.</p>
